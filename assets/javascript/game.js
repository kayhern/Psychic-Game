//callbacks are a function that is evoked or called after something happens
//lry logCall = function () {
//   console.log("locCall was called back");
// };
// setTimeout(logCall, 3000);
//event listeners like clicking on a button

//wins and losses begin with 0
let wins = 0
let losses = 0


//guesses begins with 9

//guesses so far lists all the letters the person guesses with a comma in between each guess
//once guesses counts down to 0 then guesses so far resets to nothing
//if the person guesses the correct letter then wins go up by 1
//if the person guesses 9 guesses without the correct letter then losses goes up by 1
//need to define what the random letter is for each game
